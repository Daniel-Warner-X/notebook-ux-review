# Enhancing Jupyter Notebook User Experience

Recent reviews of our Jupyter Notebooks revealed that while the notebooks we provide for POCs are fully functional, they often lack the embedded context needed to effectively inform and guide users. This gap creates a less than intuitive experience and hinders self-service. This project aims to implement the Notebook UX Review Template developed by Justin as an automated review that ensures consistency and improves usability.

* **For Designers:** Streamlining reviews of notebooks developed by Data Scientists and Developers.
* **For Data Scientists:** Providing consistent standards and improved context within their working environment. 
* **For Developers:** Facilitating seamless updates and contributions to existing notebooks.
