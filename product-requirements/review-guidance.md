**Abstracted Usability Tips for a Jupyter Notebook UX**

1.  It is very helpful when the notebook comes in an example repository with the directory structure already set. This significantly improves usability for workflows that depend on specific file names and directory structures.
2.  There should be a clear mention of the prerequisites for the notebook. Users need to understand what source material or prior knowledge is required.
3.  Each cell should have a description of what it does. This is vital for helping users understand the flow and purpose of each step.
4.  Provide guidance on selecting input data. Users need to know how much data is appropriate for different scenarios and what the connection is between the data volume and the overall objectives.
5.  Ensure descriptions focus on value and not just the technical steps. Explain why each step is important and how it contributes to the overall goal.
6.  Provide ways to validate intermediate results. Users should be able to check the output of each step to ensure it is correct and likely to produce good final results.
7.  Give context for new concepts or terms when they are introduced. Avoid assuming prior knowledge and provide enough information to understand the purpose and function of each element.
8.  Ensure descriptions are complete and informative throughout the notebook. Avoid descriptions that "trail off" or become vague.
9.  Provide guidance on parameters or settings within the notebook. Users should understand what the options are and how to choose the right ones.
10. Offer methods for reviewing generated artifacts. Users need to be able to inspect the output to make sure it is correct and meets their needs.
11. Ensure generated output files are placed in expected locations. Clearly communicate where files are saved and why.
12. Provide validation steps to ensure generated data or files are formed correctly. Avoid forcing users to manually check conditions that can be automated.
13. Embed the value proposition within the notebook. For each step or cell, include a description that explains not only how to execute the code but also why that step is important and how it contributes to the overall goal. Connect technical steps to the larger business value.
14. Conduct a thorough review of the notebook. Correct typos, remove TODOs, and fix broken links. Aim for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) release that provides a polished and professional experience.
15. Break down large notebooks into smaller, more focused ones. Give individual steps and review stages more space. Include clear checkpoints and validation steps at each stage to ensure intermediate results can be verified before proceeding. Provide guidance on how to validate these intermediate results.
