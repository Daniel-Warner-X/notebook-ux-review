Overdraft policy
We don't charge overdraft fees on this account. To help you avoid overdrawing your account, transactions will be declined and returned unpaid when you don't have enough money in your account.
If this happens, you won't be charged a bank overdraft fee, but the merchant or third party could charge you a fee. For example, you may be charged a late fee if the payment isn't received on time.
There may still be times when your account could have a negative balance, but we won't charge an overdraft fee.
