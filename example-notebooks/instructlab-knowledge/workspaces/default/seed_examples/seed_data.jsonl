Interest rates for your account are based on balance tiers, are set at our discretion and may change at any time without notice.\nTo calculate interest, we apply a daily periodic rate to the collected balance in your account each day. The daily rate that applies will depend on which balance tier your end-of-day balance falls in. We compound and pay any interest earned monthly. Interest is only paid in whole cents and we use standard rounding rules to calculate the amount. This means that an amount less than half of one cent is rounded down to zero, and an amount of half of one cent or more is rounded up to the next whole cent.\nExtra interest\nExtra interest is earned automatically when an account owner is enrolled in the Preferred Rewards program. The interest rate will increase by at least 5%, 10% or 20% over the standard rate, and is based on the Preferred Rewards tier in which you're enrolled. We may decide to pay a higher rate.\nWhere can I find information about current interest rates?\nYou can find current rate information by checking bankofamerica.com, calling the number on your account statement or visiting a financial center."}
